# 7. Delivery

The Renderer is in the mcp-grafana binary. The App resource `ui://grafana/app.html` holds the App and the Renderer.

## The bundle

- `delivery.1` The Renderer is one ES module bundle. The App build adds it to `app.html`.
- `delivery.2` A manifest next to the bundle gives `version` (the Renderer version), `sha256` (of the bundle),
  `contractVersion` (the version of this contract), `specVersions` (the viz spec versions that the Renderer
  supports) and `icons`. `icons` names each `@grafana/ui` icon that the Renderer, or a `@grafana/ui` component that
  the Renderer uses, can show. A name is `<dir>/<name>`, for example `unicons/sync`.
- `delivery.3` The App does not check `specVersion` before it calls `render`. If the `specVersion` of the viz spec is
  not in `specVersions`, the Renderer shows the `unsupported-spec-version` error (`state.3`).

## Checks

- `delivery.4` A CI check makes sure that `app.html` has one copy of React.
- `delivery.5` A CI check makes sure that the gzip size of the Renderer bundle is not larger than
  `maxBundleGzipBytes`. While the constant has no value, the check reports the size and does not fail.
- `delivery.6` A CI check makes sure that the `sha256` of the manifest is the hash of the bundle.
- `delivery.7` A CI check makes sure that the App fills its icon cache with each icon of the manifest `icons`
  (`renderer.15`), and that `app.html` makes no icon request when it draws the fixtures.
